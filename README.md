# Rest TODO endpoint

## How to run?

Run `docker compose up` and wait for a few minutes. A good opportunity to get a cup of coffee!


This command builds the docker image, installs PHP dependancies and creates some sample todo items. 

Now head to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/tasks or use the provided postman collection `todo-app.postman_collection.json` to test the endpoint.
